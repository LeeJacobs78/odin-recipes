        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is the creamiest macaroni and cheese recipe you will ever feast
            upon.  My wife can't say enough good things about this and how deliciously
            creamy and yummy it is!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>6 ounces evaporated milk</li>
            <li>6 ounces grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good
                melting cheese, such as fontina, gruyere, or jack</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add 
                just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and 
                bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. 
                Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost 
                completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, 
                about 6 minutes.</li>   
            <li>Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add 
                cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, 
                until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy 
                sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more 
                salt and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
