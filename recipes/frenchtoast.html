        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a household favorite recipe for french toast.  
            The kids just gobble these right up and I can hardly
            get any before they've eaten them all!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Large eggs</li>
            <li>2/3 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
            <li>8 thick slices 2-day-old bread (better is slightly stale)</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Maple Syrup</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the egg mixture:</strong>
                In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and 
                cinnamon. Stir in the orange zest and/or triple sec if 
                using. Whisk the mixture until well blended and pour into 
                a shallow bowl, wide enough to place a slice of the bread 
                you will be using.</li>
                
            <li><strong>Soak the bread slices in egg mixture:</strong>
                Place each slice of bread into the milk egg mixture, 
                allowing the bread to soak in some of it.</li>
                

            <li><strong>Fry the French toast:</strong>
                Melt some butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. 
                Shake off the excess egg mixture from the bread and place 
                the bread slices onto the hot skillet. Fry the French toast 
                until browned on one side, then flip and brown the other 
                side.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> 
                Serve the French toast hot with butter, maple syrup, and/or 
                fresh berries.</li>
        </ol>
